from itertools import groupby
"""
Given a string s, repeatedly delete the earliest consecutive duplicate characters.
Constraints:
 	nâ‰¤ 100, 000 where n is the length of s.
Example 1
 	Input:
		s = "abbbaac"
 	Output:
		"c"
 	Explanation:
 		"bbb"
 		are the earliest consecutive duplicate characters which gets deleted.So we have "aaac".
 		"aaa"
 		then gets deleted to end up with "c".
